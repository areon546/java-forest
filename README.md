# Forest Game

Two versions, #v1.0 is a version written 2 years ago that got reuploaded. 
#v2.0 is a work in progress version of the same concept, but rewritten from ground up, to allow for improved functionality

It was rewritten both to refresh on basic java, as well as an opportunity to learn more about git tags and other features I have rarely used.
